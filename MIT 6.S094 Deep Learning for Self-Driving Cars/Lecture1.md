	Is driving more like a conversation or a chess game?

	It's still unclear what the various layers of neural networks do. For tasks like image classification, we are able to somewhat visualize that,
	but for others like driving, it's still a mystery

	When should a neural network be able to add more layers?

	Deep learning is representation learning. In traditional machine learning, we generally provide good representations!

	Rule based systems : hand designed programs
	Classical ML: hand designed features + Mapping from features
	Repn learning: learnt features + mapping from features
		Deep learning: learnt  features + additional layers of more abstract learnt features + mapping from features

	Image colorization dataset: take new movies, and grayscale them to get labeled examples

	Image caption generation: detect words -> generate sentences -> re-rank sentences

	Moravec's paradox: the 'easy' problems are hard
		walking for robots (something which we take for granted)

	Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world
	and how to survive in it

	Visual perception: 540 million years of data (when did life start for us??)
	Bipedal movement: 230+ million years of data
	Abstract thought: 100 thousand years of data
	Abstract thought is what we consider to be reasoning. It is a new trick, perhaps less than thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. 
	It is not all that intrinsically difficult, it just seems so when we do it. 
	(simply: we have basically had more experience (data) and training for visual and motor tasks than abstract thinking, so we don't think them to be as difficult than the later)

	Walking is hard. How hard is driving?

		Human performance: 1 fatality per 100,000,000 miles
		Error rate for AI to improve upon : 0.000001
